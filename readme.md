## Kyle's Homework

  1. Learn Git Basics: (clone, push, pull request, merge, branches)
    - i did some of this today. trying to install git via homebrew. i think i installed homebrew as a first step. but confused about the next steps:- 
      ==> Next steps:
      Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
      (echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/kielay/.zprofile  
      eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"  
    - i ran brew help to demonstrate that the installation was a success. i will look up the  next steps later.
    - i downloaded github desktop app GUI for offline git management, but i think VScode does this too.
